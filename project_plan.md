# Have you Reddit? : A Subreddit Analysis
## __Matthew Borbonus - MJB288__
### __Summary :__ 
For my project, after having discussed with Na Rae in office hours, I would like to examine linguistic differences between subreddits on the social media site Reddit. Not just simply word frequency differences, but also correlation to upvotes and downvotes.
### __Data :__
* My data will be in the form of a corpus containing Reddit comments, with their subreddit source, upvote/downvote count, gilding if possible.
* Cleanup - I haven't had the oppurtunity to examine the corpus in depth, but I will probably have to cleanup comments that are very unhelpful (i.e. comments with only one character unless in a certain context like the r/askoujia) 
* Size - Very Large - The original corpus is apparently 1TB and the sample I downloaded is about 5 GB compressed, 32 GB uncompressed
* Existing corpra - I was directed to a corpus that would be perfect for my project. [The corpus in question](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/3bxlg7/i_have_every_publicly_available_reddit_comment/) :  
### __Analysis__
* End Goal: To find linguistic trends amongst subreddits, and to discover if there are any trends amongst high upvotes and downvotes. 
* Frequency counts, statistical values. Being able to filter out key words that are not useful to the research. Computing the upvote/downvote to frequecy ratio.
* Hypothesis: I do have a small selection of smaller hypothesis to work with : 
    *  "This" has a higher frequency usage than "the". 
    * The words/comments that get the highest upvote average are some of the highest frequency used in their respective subreddit.
    * I think this corpus takes place before guilding or gold but if there is guilding/gold in this time period: Guilded/Gold will be a very high frequency word compared to others (ex "Edit : thank for the gold" is one that i've seen quite a bit for the past couple years)
    * r/news or any similar news subreddit will have a similar usage of political terms (e.x. "politician", "election") to r/politics (since both usually have the base post linking directly to a news article)
    * As a bold statement, I will say "awww" (searched with regular expression due to spelling variations) will not be in the top 50-100 words in the subreddit r/aww. 
* I do not have any need for predictive analysis, but It could prove to be an entertaining side project (if I ended up with extra time and learned how to do machine learning) to see if we could use machine learning to see if it could classify reddit comments by the correct subreddit and if its a high or low upvote count.
### __Presentation__
I don't have much in mind, probably your standard run of the mill powerpoint presentation on my findings and methods. If I can, I usually try to incorporate humor into my presentations. Simple puns, or random unexpected phrases used to describe a concept or thing, that kind of thing. Is there any sound system in the room? I only used sound once or twice over my college career, and I will probably not use it here, but I do like to weigh my options.
