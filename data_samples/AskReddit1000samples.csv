23,Miranda_Mandarin,"I know a girl who is like the guy in this story. 

She flaps around the guys she dates and dotes on them in an almost maddening manner. She txts them constantly asking them how they are, telling them she loves them, telling them she adores them and in return? They tell her she's annoying. They complain she txts too much. They won't respond for days at a time and when she finally gets a response she's in tears she's been so worried.

Irl she isn't any better: constant hand-holding, constant PDAs, making sure they're happy and comfortable, she'll pretend to trip over and stumble into them...it's honestly one of the cringiest things I've ever seen. Meanwhile they're staring into space or just smiling politely at her. Never making any moves of their own.

Of course she gets used a lot. Her last boyfriend just never stopped complaining about how irritating she was but kept expecting her to pay for things. She even paid his fines. I asked her why she insisted on still being with someone who was such a jerk to her. She said she wanted to make it work and ""if we can get through this rough patch, just think how strong our relationship will be!"" 

The second one barely showed up to their dates. She invited him to the university formal and the night before she found out he hadn't rented a tux, hadn't purchased a ticket, and had no transport to get there (neither of them drive.) Again, she spent *a lot* of money on him.

Her current one is a Chinese man who is a fair bit older than her. He has recently purchased an investment property under her name and plans to purchase more. I suspect he's using her and will eventually try for a green card marriage but of course I can't prove anything and every time I've voiced concern about her boyfriends she's gotten seriously upset with me. 

She said at eighteen years old than she ""planned"" to get married by age 25 (at that time she was single). She's currently 27.

Poor thing. And amongst all this she claims to be a feminist.

Edit: 

Okay, while I thought I was quite clear that my issue was the way my friend gets treated by men, some people are a bit confused and think my problem is that women who call themselves feminists shouldn't get married. I've no idea how people confused themselves given I gave *three* examples as to how horribly my friend has been treated but...uhh...I guess people will just interpret things how they want. 

So in case I was still unclear, no, I have NO ISSUE WHATSOEVER with my friend wanting to get married someday. My issue is that in her desperation to not be all alone, she has tried to cling to relationships that were dead before they began and allowed men to use her when she deserved better. She is treated more like a maid than a girlfriend a lot of the time. I think it is kind of bizarre that she calls herself an empowered feminist when her entire self-worth is wrapped up in whether she's managed to tie the knot by now. I am not a feminist myself but it certainly makes me wonder what the point of feminism is these days.

A few feminists themselves have also contacted me saying that I'm being too judgemental. To that I ask: would you really sit back and allow your best friends to be hurt by the men they love? Is that really what feminism is now?

80,ohbbyno,"Ok..part 2: 

I went back to my cousin's house a few days later. It aroused no suspicion from our parents since he lived a few blocks away and played together all the time. I brought my little sister with to play with my cousin's younger siblings. My sister was 9 just like my cousin but I wouldn't dream of telling her. She was a huge blab and my cousin and I had decided that we didn't want anyone to know yet. Especially not the adults. As for my cousin, we'll call him Connor from now on.

He didn't know I was coming, but he was glad I did, because he had done some research on the house.  He told me that in the first owners, an elderly couple who had built the house around the turn  of the century, had moved out and never sold the house. They left it to their son when they died, and their son left it to his son. But nobody had ever lived in it since the first owners moved out, so it had been empty since about 1948, confirming my guess about the age of the glass bottles in the bathroom windowsill. The house had just been used to store things ever since. 

We had already planned for our second visit. We had shoes this time, and we each brought a flashlight. Both of us had our own pistols, handguns, rifles etc. but we didn't dare try to sneak them out of the house, so we each brandished our pocketknives, freshly sharpened for the occasion.

We skittered along the ""path"" between the old house and the back of his fence. It wasn't a path, really. It was a space about 5-6 feet wide, covered in twigs and leaves and those awful sticker plants. All of this was brown, which was probably why we didn't see the ball of twine on our last adventure. It was nestled against the side of the old house under a pile of leaves. It was about the size of an adult's fist and it was brown, as twine usually is. It looked old, and it was rather heavy. I pocketed it and we moved on. 

We crept around to the front of the house and quickly slipped inside. We didn't want to linger on the off chance that someone might see us. It was, after all, broad daylight. 

In the house nothing had changed. It was exactly as we had left it. I did pocket the cassette, as one of you was hoping. The bikes were all still there. So were the chainsaw and the old glass bottles. It appeared that nobody had been in or out since we left...no one probably had; it had only been a few days. We went straight to the last room after poking around a bit in the other three and finding nothing of interest. The cross was still there. After standing around a bit, listening for any thumps, we mustered up all the courage we had and decided to go down to the basement.

I know what you're thinking: how cliche. But after creeping down the stairs and around the corner, knives brandished and ready, we found....nothing. There were a few piles of leaves here and there, an old empty pop can, and other assorted trash. But otherwise nothing. No sign of anything amiss. 

So we went back upstairs, dismissing the thump we heard a few days before as just the house settling(or falling apart, considering how old it was) and left. But instead of going back, we decided to check out the other side of the house. 

I really wish we hadn't. There was a pair of old storm doors that we hadn't seen from the basement. The paint, if there ever had been any, had completely chipped off and so now the doors were gray. They were nailed shut, so we ran back(neither of us wanted to be left behind) to grab a hammer from his dad's tool box. We went to work on those doors, but there had to have been hundreds of nails there, just nailed in crooked and all over the place. It was getting darker by now, so we said fuck that and went home. 

Next day I came over again and work continued. We had the doors open about halfway by now, and we could see a the cellar underneath. Neither of us could fit through the space, though, so we kept pulling the nails. It was about 3 in the afternoon by the time we had finished, and when we got the doors open we found no stairs and a drop of about ten feet. We peered into it as far as we could without falling in. It smelled so, so bad. We were sure it  was the source of the smell in the old house. It was pretty tiny, as far as we could tell. It was narrow, and there was a large wall right in the center of it, with narrow paths along both sides, leading into the dark. The floor was stained, and we both knew it was blood. Maybe our kid imaginations were going wild, though. Who knows? 

But one thing I do know is that that sound will haunt me forever. The sound on the cassette. We played it that day, on his cassette player. It was static for about five minutes, and we were ready to give up. Then a scream. An awful, tortured scream. The screams continued, until they were suddenly ended, right in the middle of one. Then static again. 

We threw away the cassette, and never spoke of it again, nor did we ever go in the house again. 

Something awful happened in that place. Unless it was a joke, which it could have been and I hope it was. But I don't think so. We never unraveled the ball of twine. I unintentionally left it at his house that day, lying on the ground by the trampoline. Shortly after they bought a house and moved to an acreage in Ceylon, Minnesota, just 20 miles away. They still own the house. It sits empty now, and they use it to store things. Like mountain bikes, ironically. I still live in Fairmont. I could drive there, get the ball of twine and unravel it. But I think it best to leave the ball of twine where it is. I don't want to have anything to do with that house ever again.

The tl;dr is that before digital phone systems the phone network was entirely controlled via tones at various frequencies, the exact same sort you hear when you dial numbers on a landline touchtone phone (if you ever have, that is..). People reverse engineered the system and built all sorts of little machines called Boxes that would make it do weird things via tone manipulation, everything from setting up party lines and getting free long distance to turning phones into one-way listening devices. Screwing with the phone system in this way was called Phreaking.

Well lady, I've got a line up, it didn't say you have any points and you're holding your fucking debit card next to the pinpad. I tried explaining the situation to her and she just got pissy. (You know, when you try to calmly and logically explain what's going on to someone and it only pisses them off more.) What am I supposed to do? Snap my fingers and make the magic happen? So she's pissed off and swearing at me, cant recall what all she was saying cuz i was caught off guard and shellshocked by her losing it so suddenly. She paid with debit, the whole time complaining how i didnt even offer to use the points. YEAH CUZ ITS NOT CONNECTED SO IT WONT POP UP TO TELL ME YOU HAVE POINTS. Her receipt printed, and with a smile and nicest tone of voice i said. ""And you have yourself a wonderful day ma'am"" set her receipt down in front of her on the counter and tapped it a couple times smiling at her. The next customer starts shifting over a bit and i start scanning. Bitch lady goes ""Just give me a fucking minute to get my shit"" as shes taking her stuff from the till.

I wanted to kind of get to the crux of the issue, and that seems to be it for you. It's extremely important to realize that the Muslim communities in the US have assimilated very well, and do not have the same issues as in European countries. Overall views of Muslims are largely split on party lines in the US, but the crime rates of their neighborhoods are lower than average. Muslims feel much more accepted in the states (even though still not accepted in the mainstream) as they do in Europe. The reason for this isn't because European Muslims are somehow more violent or criminal, it's because the society at large is very unwelcoming to anything different.

In terms of safer, I believe homogenous societies to be the winner using your metric, just because they are a bunch of like minded people.

In terms of ""better"" using wealth, it favors heterogenous countries because those countries will be much more forward thinking, incorporating more world views and the values of a variety of different peoples into their economies.

&gt;I'm just gonna go ahead and flip the coin. In a society where you can trust that the legal system will in fact in most cases convict actual rapists, the answer to this question is obviously yes. However, at least where I'm from, the jury (which does not work the same way it does in America) more often than not lets offenders who have even admitted the crime off the hook in cases concerning rape. In one of the cases (from my own hometown) the educated judge had to step in and overturn the jury's decision because the evidence was so clear, and the rapist so dangerous, that his conscience didn't allow him to release the rapist. I can link to some cases if you want, however all the articles will be in Norwegian as I don't think they've ever made any international headlines.

&gt;My point is that yes, I do believe anonymity should be provided for a number of reasons. It's about the fundamental right to have a fair trial. However, there is also the case where rape is extremely difficult to prove. According to statistics released by the police in my country, around 20% of all rapes make it to the police, and from that statistic 5% make it to court, and from that statistic 1% ends up convicted. This is based on what's believed to be actual rapes, the ones that does happen.

&gt;There is also a separate statistic on false accusations (just to get that one out of the way), that estimates that the numbers for false accusations in relation to rape is about the same as any other criminal felony. Which means that false accusations do happen, but not more frequently in cases about rape than they do in other cases. Unfortunately a false accusation of rape can be extremely damaging to an average Jane or Joe, but it's also found that most false accusations of rape are:

&gt;Clearly false and overstated and easy to prove wrong (and does have a 'named offender')
Does not have a named offender, but is made by people with severe mental disorders and often a history of sexual abuse from childhood.
The statistics show that men and women both falsely report rape just about the same amount of times within a year.
The people accused in these cases are mostly men, but they rarely actually name an offender. Lose descriptions of appearance are far more common, and those descriptions are often based on stereotypes: Foreign offenders jumped someone on their way home from work, or school, or a party.
Now that false accusations are out of the way, the statistics of actual rape can mean a number of things, however it absolutely means that there are number of rapists out there that have not been convicted. When someone has been let off the hook a number of times, it's also a matter of safety for the potential victims. We should find a way to solve this problem that can both give the accused of rape their anonymity, and the potential victims of actual rapists that haven't been convicted a way to stay safe.

&gt;PS: The statistic is not gendered, so all statistics applies to both men and women. I'll gladly give up my sources if anyone wants them, it's just that they're all in Norwegian :P

I think it's important to differentiate the question further. One thing is the judicial system and government. They, in my opinion, should absolutely have a record and that record made public about rape accusations. 

However, where I think people have the bigger problem is the media. And it needs to be reeled in. I don't believe the media EVER does a good job of handling these cases.

&gt; Collisions that produce quark-gluon plasma (a soup of quarks that are as close to free as they can get) also produce other particles. Mesons produced in the collision that are made up of a quark and its own antiquark, called quarkonium, can be used to determine the temperature. They can exist in several different states, but higher energy states are less tightly bound and can be more easily disrupted by the particles in the plasma. Because the energy of those relatively unbound quarks affects what states they're able to disrupt, the suppression of different states (how common they are relative to what you would expect from the collision) can give an idea of the average energy of the QGP.

Keep in mind that I had absolutely no contact with the accuser in over two years, and lived in a town over 20 miles away. I have never been arrested in my life, am a decorated veteran with 8 yrs of active duty overseas. What resulted from this? Me going into debt for 10k to pay for a lawyer to defend me in court. The restraining order was thrown out for lack of any evidence. Meanwhile my reputation at work and with friends changed all because I was accused of shit I never did, etc. The judge even stated that he was in disbelief that the judge who had originally signed the restraining actually signed it, based upon the claims which had no validity or proof. Some of the claims included things that would have been public record if in fact they ever happened. There is no innocent until proven guilty in this country. What happened to my accuser? Nothing at all. She should have been locked up in jail for the lies. Protection to the accused should be the norm. Slam the true liars. My friends and family told me that she admitted to the lies in order to keep some of my belongings (which she still had but I had no idea because I thought I had been robbed when I had a 13 year relationship with her). Some people are trash and don't deserve the life they have. I can totally relate to OP. Where is all that money now? Gone forever, along with the years of trust built up upon constant work!

628,ChefBoiRC,"In particular I am with an asphalt company (but our parent company has a whole construction business), where we sell/make products for companies (sister companies and other outside companies) that go out and pave the road. 

My field is at least what I feel like I do, is similar to a pharmaceutical lab but applied to this field instead. Transportation is a big industry. 

The products that I help to research and check for quality go onto the road, have to fit specific state/city standards; as well as various weather conditions, etc. variables for location (and nowadays the new eco-friendly stuff). Because for keeping roads in good condition there are many aspects, like type of rocks to use, emulsions (the liquid mixed with the rock that creates the top layer to a road), etc. to suit the environment, the type of surfacing it will put on like roads/parking lots/etc. Having this all in-house alleviates the costs of having to out source a lot of this work to outside labs and such (we are accredited).

I don't know if the city I live in is safer or more dangerous than others, but I can think of five incidents off the top of my head that ranged from highly suspicious to blatant kidnapping attempts to people I know when they were kids.

My sister's friend and her siblings were almost grabbed by two guys in a van on their walk home from school one day. The oldest was 11 I think, not a little kid.

My old friend's sister was playing outside at about 5 years old, when this guy started driving up and down the street, slowing down to watch her every time he passed. Her mom was gardening nearby, but apparently out of sight of the guy. She realized the what was going on the 3rd or 4th time he drove past.

A guy came to my school during a multicultural event and started wandering around, asking kids to leave the school with him and help him find his puppy. By the time some kids realized it was weird and told an adult, he had been left, fortunately.

Earlier this year, a woman was jogging one mid-morning with her toddler in a stroller. Two guys standing on the side of the street pretty much ambushed her, one grabbed her and the other guy grabbed the stroller. The mom was able to punch the guy going for her in the throat and she grabbed the stroller back and ran.

About two months after that incident, another guy was at a park with his young son, pushing him on the swings. Some random guy walked up super casually, as if he was just passing through the park, then turned around and grabbed the kid right off the freaking swing and ran. The dad was able to grab his kid by the arm or leg or something, and the kidnapper gave up and ran.

There was another case a few years ago involving an 9 or 10 year old boy chasing down a kidnapper who grabbed the boy's 3 year old brother off a playground. I can't swear that one was also in my city, I could be misremembering, but I think it was.

And none of those stories are including the kidnapping attempts that have happen to adult women I know.

Point is, I don't live in a crime ridden city, but I know enough people that were nearly kidnapped to not feel totally comfortable with leaving a kid alone outside. With 4 or more friends, sure, that's better odds. But apparently kidnappers will try to grab a group of 3 kids off the street, so that's my cut off.",True,none,0,drjpju4,False,t3_7l1zsm,t1_driw01d,/r/AskReddit/comments/7l1zsm/what_is_the_worst_case_of_helicopter_parenting/drjpju4/,1514929499,-1,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,public,False

The basic principle already exists in the legal system. Google the phrases ""preponderance of the evidence"" ""clear and convincing evidence"" and ""beyond a reasonable doubt."" It's not in the criminal system, just the civil, but the basic principle exists nonetheless. 

Burden of proof was a poor choice of words, I'm not referring to the evidence needed for conviction. What I meant was that the potential stigma that could follow an accusation of rape is substantially worse than one for assault or theft or any other crime. That isn't limited to rape, either, murder and other heinous crimes I would agree with as well. Ideally, all crimes would be anonymous until convicted, but I think it is more essential for this category especially to have protected identities.

Sometimes they just offer parents who need help a way to get it. You ever wonder about that kid who's always filthy, smells bad, doesn't brush their teeth, barely speaks, and is still wearing a diaper all day at five? It's not their fault.
